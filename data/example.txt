Under iron restriced condition many bacteria produced iron chealating molecules called siderophore. Siderophore chealate iron and supply to bacterial cell by outer membrane receptors. A great variation is seen in siderophore structure produced by many bacteria. There are three main kinds of siderophores known as hydroxamate, catecholate and carboxylate. Siderophore production can be obtained under iron restrict media and many researcher have produced siderophore from bacteria on succinate media. Siderophore and their derivative have large application in agriculture as to increase soil fertility and biocontrol for fungal pathogen. In medicine the most important application is selective drug delivery, a Trojan horse strategy, to defeat drug resistant bacteria. Siderophore also used to reduce the level of metal contamination in environment specifically from soil and water.
Suppose a person who is agnostic about most philosophical issues wishes to have true philosophical beliefs but equally wishes to avoid false philosophical beliefs. I argue that this truth-seeking, error-avoiding agnostic would not have good grounds for pursuing philosophy. Widespread disagreement shows that pursuing philosophy is not a reliable method of discovering true answers to philosophical questions. More likely than not, pursuing philosophy leads to false belief. Many attempts to rebut this sceptical argument fail.
